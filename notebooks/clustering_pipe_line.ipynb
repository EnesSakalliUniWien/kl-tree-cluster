    "\n",
    "For critical analyses, calibrate df using permutation test on the actual tree structure.\n",

    "### 1. Updated `chi_square_test.py`\n",
    "- Added `parent_distribution` parameter (optional)\n",

    "- Fallback: Uses theoretical `df = num_features` if no parent distribution\n",

    "## What This Means\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before**: All features contributed equally \u2192 df = p (e.g., df = 50 for 50 features)\n",
